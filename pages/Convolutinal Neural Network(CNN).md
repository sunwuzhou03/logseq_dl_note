- Assuming a fixed image size
  id:: 656dbef6-97c9-4e45-8746-d69f176b812a
- when the image are in different sizes, we can resize them in the same size.
- # image classification
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1701691563803_0.png)
	- the image combine by three dimensions.
	- In order to input the image into machine model, we can flatten the 3d-tensor(image)

	- when the model weight increasing, the possibility of overfitting will increasing
	- maybe we don't need to use fully connected network, we just need to extract some special feature

	- can different neurons have different sizes of receptive field?
	- cover only some channels? no, some feature only appear in red(or green, blue) channel
	- not square receptive field?
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1701697991649_0.png)
	- consider all channels, stride, padding
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1701698108748_0.png)
	- each receptive field needs a "beak" detector? no, we can use share parameters

	- The above way use in image recognition will have low model bias. When we use cnn in other task, we need to consider if the pattern satisfy the above mode

	- use filter to do the inner product
